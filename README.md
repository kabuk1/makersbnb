# MakersBnB

## Goals for this team project
* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch_PR_merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

## Set up
Clone this repo and then run the command below:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ rspec
```

## Project specifications
### Headline specification
- Any signed-up user can list a new space.
- Users can list multiple spaces.
- Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
- Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
- Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
- Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
- Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
